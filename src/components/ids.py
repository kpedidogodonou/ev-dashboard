                            non-electric vehicle sales from 2010 to 2024. While total car sales 
                            fluctuated slightly over the years—especially around 2020 due 
                            to the pandemic—EV sales (highlighted in red) have grown steadily 
                            and significantly in recent years. By 2024, EVs represent a much 
                            larger portion of total sales, marking a visible shift in the 
                            automotive market. However, non-EV cars (in blue) still dominate 
                            in absolute numbers, showing that the global transition to electric 
                            vehicles is advancing but far from complete."""

SESSION_II_TITLE = "2. Global EV Penetration: Who’s Leading on the Road?"
SESSION_II_COMMENT="""This graph shows the share of cars currently in use that are electric 
                        across selected countries from 2010 to 2024. Norway stands out as 
                        the global leader, reaching over 30% electric vehicle (EV) 
                        penetration in its national fleet — a result of strong 
                        government incentives, infrastructure investments, and early 
                        policy adoption. Sweden and China also show consistent growth, 
                        with China surpassing 10% by 2024. In contrast, regions like the 
                        United States and Germany are progressing more slowly, reflecting differences 
                        in policy support and consumer adoption. The world average remains below 5%, 
                        highlighting that despite growing EV sales, the global vehicle fleet is still 
                        largely composed of internal combustion engine cars."""

SESSION_III_TITLE = "3. Electric Shift: Battery vs Plug-In Hybrid Sales Trends"
SESSION_III_COMMENT = """This chart highlights the global shift toward electric mobility through the 
                        rising share of battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) 
                        sold between 2010 and 2024. The data clearly shows a strong upward trend in both
                        categories, particularly after 2020. BEVs (in blue) account for the larger and
                        faster-growing share, surpassing 13% of all new car sales by 2024. PHEVs (in red) 
                        also saw growth but remain secondary in market share. This suggests that consumers and 
                        manufacturers are increasingly favoring fully electric vehicles over hybrid alternatives 
                        as infrastructure improves and zero-emission policies gain momentum."""
